1. Introduction

The year 2022 marked an important milestone in Colombia's economic recovery following the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic. Foreign trade, as an engine of growth, played a fundamental role in this recovery. However, the international context, characterized by high inflation, geopolitical conflicts, and supply chain disruptions, presented new challenges for the Colombian export sector.

2. The Global Scenario and its Impact on Colombia

The international environment in 2022 was characterized by:

High inflation: Global inflation, driven by factors such as supply chain disruptions and expansionary monetary policies, impacted production costs and the prices of imported products.
Geopolitical uncertainty: Geopolitical conflicts, such as the war in Ukraine, generated volatility in the energy and raw materials markets, affecting the prices and availability of certain products. Supply chain disruptions: Although an improvement was observed compared to 2021, supply chain disruptions continued to be a challenge for international trade.

These external factors influenced the performance of Colombian foreign trade, creating both opportunities and challenges.

Greater importance of trade agreements: The trade agreements signed by Colombia, such as the Free Trade Agreement with the United States, played an important role in the recovery of foreign trade.
Impact of inflation: Global inflation impacted production costs and the prices of imported products, putting pressure on the competitiveness of Colombian exports.
