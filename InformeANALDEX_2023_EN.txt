In this report, we will analyze in-depth the performance of Colombian foreign trade this year, identifying the main trends, challenges, and opportunities.

2. The Global Scenario and its Impact on Colombia

The international environment in 2023 was characterized by:

High inflation: Global inflation, driven by factors such as supply chain disruptions and expansionary monetary policies, impacted production costs and the prices of imported products.
Geopolitical uncertainty: Geopolitical conflicts, such as the war in Ukraine, generated volatility in the energy and raw materials markets, affecting the prices and availability of certain products.

Greater importance of trade agreements: Trade agreements signed by Colombia, such as the Free Trade Agreement with the United States, played an important role in the recovery of foreign trade.
Impact of inflation: Global inflation impacted production costs and the prices of imported products, putting pressure on the competitiveness of Colombian exports.
